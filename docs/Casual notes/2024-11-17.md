### Another week
Time fleets. It's been another week. There's only 20 days left on my exchange bank account. I really want to slow down the pace and enjoy the last few days here. 
Ah, I'm feeling a little tired today so I won't write too much. Just a brief update on what's going on lately.

I picked up anime again. Can't really remember what triggers me. But I finished *Grand Blue* and *Too Many Losing Heroines!* in the past few days. I found it satisfying to binge-watching all 12 episodes in one go. But the bad news is that both animes are so good that I endded up staying up late till 4 or 5 in the morning. This is very bad for my health. Plus the finals are drawing near, I have to get back to a normal schedule. I just added a new doc embedded with bangumi anime colletion. [Here](../Misc/Anime-Collection.md) is the link.
