# Food Tasting in NTU

So, I’m trying to improve my English by writing down random stuff about my life in Singapore. This includes anything from thoughts I have, cool food I try, or just whatever pops into my head. First up—food! Because, why not?

I’ll keep this updated with the food I try at NTU, giving each dish a rating from 1 to 5 stars. I’ll also throw in some prices, where you can get it, and how I feel about the taste.

### Canteen 11

1. **Mix Rice and Veggies** :star::star::star:
      - **Price:** Around \$3-\$5
      - **Recommended:** Broccoli-cauliflower mix, sweet and sour ribs.
      - **Review:** Not sure what to eat? Mix rice is always a safe bet. You get to choose from over 15 different options of veggies and meat. It’s your typical Chinese food, but they have my favorite broccoli every day. And honestly, the other dishes are even better than the ones I had back in China.
      PS: I've tried so much Mix rice and veggie in singapore and really, couldn't tell which one really impressed me. In a daily senario, go for the nearest one can save you time and avoid suffering from making decisions.

2. **Japanese Food** :star:
      - **Price:** \$5-\$7
      - **Not Recommended**
      - **Review:** I haven’t tried everything on the menu, but I went for the fried chicken don on a friend’s recommendation. The soft-boiled egg was nice, but the chicken? Way too greasy and missing some veggies. I also tried the fried shrimp don for \$6.50, which wasn’t terrible, but not worth the price.

3. **Malay Food** :star::star:
      - **Price:** \$2.50-\$3.50
      - **Recommended:** Briyani, Nasi Lemak
      - **Review:** On a tight budget? Malay food is cheap and… average. The oily rice and fried chicken with spicy Malay sauce will fill you up, but there’s barely any veggies other than cucumber, so not the most balanced meal.

4. **Fruit** :star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$1-\$2
      - **Recommended:** Papaya
      - **Review:** After a heavy meal, some fruit is the perfect way to refresh your mouth and mood! The auntie at the fruit stall is super nice. Prices are a bit higher than at the wet market, but hey, the convenience is worth it.

### Saraca Canteen

1. **Indian Food** :star::star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$4.50-\$8
      - **Recommended:** Briyani, Naan, potatoes
      - **Review:** Since I landed in Singapore and had my first meal—Briyani and Mee Goreng—I’ve been hooked on Indian food. I love how they fry the rice with all those spices, and the curry chicken always hits the spot. It’s a bit spicy, which is a plus for me. The naan is also a must-try—so chewy and perfect for dipping in curry.
      Oh, and don’t miss the potatoes! Not exactly sure how they cook them, but they’re chunked with the skin on, fried with spices until they’re soft and mashed. It’s an amazing, flavorful side dish.

2. **Fruits and Drinks** :star::star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$0.90-\$3.50
      - **Recommended:** Avocado milkshake
      - **Review:** I’m obsessed with the avocado milkshake! It’s thick, creamy, and has that strong avocado taste. At \$3, it's a great dessert option after a meal. But fair warning: not everyone is a fan of avocado’s fatty texture. My roommate’s not into it at all.

3. **Mixed Rice and Veggie** :star::star::star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$4.5-\$6
      - **Recommended:** Fresh broccoli, stewed beef with potatoes, mala fish, scrambled eggs with tomatoes
      - **Review:** The best mixed rice and veggie in NTU. I usually have lunch or more precisely brunch.(Since I often get up after 11:30). Order broccoli, beef and eggs for 5 SGD, grab a cup of ice milo and then take the red campus loop to the iot lab. It has been my recent routine. Let's take about the food taste. The best part of the broccoli is that the cook really keeps it cruchy and fresh, not too well nor too raw, just right the way I like. The beef is chewy yet not too hard, and the potatoes are soft and flavorful. 

### North hill Canteen
1. **Taiwanese Food** :star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$4-\$5
      - **Recommended:** Braised pork rice
      - **Review:** I’ve only tried the braised pork rice, but it’s so good! The pork is tender and flavorful. Mix it with the rice and you'll get a super satisfying meal. Portion is the only problem-only get me 80% full.

2. **Thai Food** :star::star:
      - **Price:** \$4-\$6
      - **Recommended:** Green curry Fried Rice
      - **Review:** : It serves a variety of Thai dishes, I've tried the green curry fried rice and Fried Hefen. As for the fried hefen, I don't see too much difference from the Chinese version. The green curry fried rice is Okay but still, where's the taste of green curry?

3. **Korean Food**:star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$4-\$8
      - **Recommended:** Kimchi Fried Rice
      - **Review:** : Kimchi fried rice there has a decent taste and price. To clarify, I'm not Korean and neither have I been to Korea, so I can't say if it's authentic. But to me, it's much better than the one I had in China. Just have a try!
  
### Fine Food (SS)

1. **Noodle Stall** :star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$5 - \$7
      - **Recommended:** Beef Noodle
      - **Review:** This is recommended by my fellow teammate in Iot lab Hu Bowen. It's worth mentioning that the noodel is handmade which is quiet precious and rare in Singapore. And the soup is aromatic. As for the beef, I'd give it an average score. However, the biggest problem is the fact that you have to wait in a long queue for so many students and faculty likes to eat here since its a little more convenient. Avoid the peak hours.

### Jurong Point

1. Jolibee :star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$10 - \$15
      - **Recommended:** Chickenjoy
      - **Review:**  I heard about Jolibee from a bilibili channel called "meetfood 觅食" and it is believed that Jolibee serves the best fried chicken all over the US. I'm always being willing to give it a shot however it's not accessible in China. However, last week, I happened to find one in Jurong Point and didn't hesitate to try it. I bought three pieces of chickenjoy sided with rice, a small serve of fries as well as a cup of coke. I fisrt tried a fired chicken nugget but it tuned out way too dry and tough to eat. So I have to dip it into the sauce. Speaking of the sauce, it isn’t very thick; it's on the thinner side, but it’s still rich in flavor and has a wonderful or magical aroma. I then tried the drumstick and it was much better than the nugget. Charactirized by the crispy skin and juicy meat yet not outstanding.(But at least better than KFC) So, as a conclusion, this experience fell a little short of my expectations. 
2. **GOKOKU Janpanese Bakery** :star::star::star::star:
      - **Price:** \$2 - \$4
      - **Recommended:** 
      - **Review:**
