# Preface
This is a set of notes for the Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics course, Fall 2023, at ZJU. Iâ€™ve long considered taking notes for this course but struggled to find an efficient method. Now, I believe Markdown and LaTeX are the perfect tools for the task. So, here it is - my first note written with Markdown and LaTeX. I will used English for the majority of this note to keep it concise and, in the process, familiarize myself with Academic English. Please forgive any inappropriate usage.
